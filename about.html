							Hi, hello. My friends call me James. I’m the illustrator behind Tales of Kavaya. I absolutely adore
							drawing, cartoons, and all things magical. Since I was a young girl, I’ve always
							wanted to make a comic. Unfortunately, I’ve never actually gotten past the character design phase. That
							is, until now! Creating a comic with my friends has been a dream come true. I
							hope you’ll grow to love Tales of Kavaya as much as I do.

							Hi, my name is KC. When I was younger, my dream job was to become an animator. I used to love drawing,
							writing stories, and reading/watching anything with magic or superpowers. But as I grew older, I got
							busier and busier with work. I lost my passion to draw and write and felt like it was a waste of time. One
							day, my friends came to me with an idea to write a comic book. I was excited to join them on their
							adventure and it rekindled my passion to write (still working on rekindling my passion to draw lol). The
							whole creative process from making up names for mystical deadly plants to designing magical creatures with
							all their odd little quirks has been so much fun and a great escape from reality. With this, my new dream
							is for our comic to be enjoyed by millions of people as we have enjoyed making it!

							Hi! I'm the one responsible for building out the site. If you find any bugs please email us. I'm just a
							guy with a passion for web development and all things magical. When James wanted to make a web comic, I
							squealed at the opportunity to flex my growing web development muscles. I hope you enjoy the world we
							created together.
