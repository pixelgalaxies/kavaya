						<h3>The Witches of Aldarath</h3>
						<p>When Azreal demoted the Order of Braylon, he had arranged for a new group to take it's place. After learning the magical origin of the mirrors the group used to communicate, they chose to carry on the name of the mirrors' creator. They call themselves The Witches of Aldarath.</p>

						<h3>Azreal</h3>
						<p>The Ghost King || Necromancer || Gillamoor || 499</p>
						<p>Azreal is arguably the most powerful witch in Kavaya. This is in part due to his Gift of Necromancy, which has manifested in strange ways. His abilities entail agelessness, communication with the deceased, and the power to raise the dead. His Gift also allows him to wield Chaos Magic without the deadly reprecussions. On the late king's deathbed, Azreal was chosen to rule Kavaya, a postion he begrudgingly upholds.

						<h3>Grey Parish</h3>
						<p>The Parish Girl || Tempest || Seamery || 19</p>
						<p>A scrappy girl from Seamery, Grey Parish isn't one to shy away from a fight. Despite being only 19, Grey has mastered the art of combining her tempestuous powers and her hand to hand combat skills. This gives her an edge in her frequent bar fights and has earned her a reputation of not being one to test. Grey refuses to believe the reports of her parents' deaths. Though, in their absence, she runs the family business all the while keeping an eye on the horizon in the hopes that she'll see their red sails. </p>

						<h3>Rowan Blake</h3>
						<p>The Northern Flame || Blaze || Igasho || 28</p>
						<p>To the north lies Igasho, a vast, snowy plain filled with mystical creatures and those who would do them harm. There, justice comes in the form of an elite group called the Jinwa. The leader of this group is Rowan Blake, a young woman driven by a fierce desire to defend the defenseless and enforce the law of the land like her grandfather before her. Rowan sees everyday as a chance to live up to her grandfather's legacy; one of kindess, honesty, but most importantly, righteousness. Throughout Igasho, she is known as: The Northern Flame. </p>
