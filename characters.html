						<h3>The Witches of Aldarath</h3>
						<p>When Azreal demoted the Order of Braylon, he had arranged for a new group to take it's place. After learning
							the magical origin of the mirrors the group used to communicate, they chose to carry on the name of the mirrors'
							creator. They call themselves The Witches of Aldarath.</p>

						<h3>Azreal</h3>
						<p>The Ghost King || Necromancer || Gillamoor || 499</p>
						<p>Azreal is arguably the most powerful witch in Kavaya. This is in part due to his Gift of Necromancy, which has
							manifested in strange ways. His abilities entail agelessness, communication with the deceased, and the power to
							raise the dead. His Gift also allows him to wield Chaos Magic without the deadly reprecussions. On the late
							king's deathbed, Azreal was chosen to rule Kavaya, a postion he begrudgingly upholds.

						<h3>Grey Parish</h3>
						<p>The Parish Girl || Tempest || Seamery || 19</p>
						<p>A scrappy girl from Seamery, Grey Parish isn't one to shy away from a fight. Despite being only 19, Grey has
							mastered the art of combining her tempestuous powers and her hand to hand combat skills. This gives her an edge
							in her frequent bar fights and has earned her a reputation of not being one to test. Grey refuses to believe the
							reports of her parents' deaths. Though, in their absence, she runs the family business all the while keeping an
							eye on the horizon in the hopes that she'll see their red sails. </p>

						<h3>Rowan Blake</h3>
						<p>The Northern Flame || Blaze || Igasho || 28</p>
						<p>To the north lies Igasho, a vast, snowy plain filled with mystical creatures and those who would do them harm.
							There, justice comes in the form of an elite group called the Jinwa. The leader of this group is Rowan Blake, a
							young woman driven by a fierce desire to defend the defenseless and enforce the law of the land like her
							grandfather before her. Rowan sees everyday as a chance to live up to her grandfather's legacy; one of kindess,
							honesty, but most importantly, righteousness. Throughout Igasho, she is known as: The Northern Flame. </p>

						<p>On the banks of the great swamp in the south, Ont’ha, there dwells a man named Morgan Forrest. His simple life

							the trouble of Gillamoor. Now, Morgan’s life consists of traversing Kavaya, serving the realm, while still
							managing to find the time to keep his promise to his fairy friend, Gudglalo.</p>
