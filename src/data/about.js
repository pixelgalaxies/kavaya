Since I was a young girl, I’ve always wanted to make a comic. Unfortunately, I’ve never actually gotten past the character design phase. That is, until now! Creating a comic with my friends has been a dream come true. I hope you’ll grow to love Tales of Kavaya as much as I do.",

But as I grew older, I got busier and busier with work. I lost my passion to draw and write and felt like it was a waste of time. One day, my friends came to me with an idea to write a comic book. I was excited to join them on their adventure and it rekindled my passion to write (still working on rekindling my passion to draw lol). The whole creative process from making up names for mystical deadly plants to designing magical creatures with all their odd little quirks has been so much fun and a great escape from reality. With this, my new dream is for our comic to be enjoyed by millions of people as we have enjoyed making it!",
